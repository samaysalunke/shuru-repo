Knowledge Base Quality Improvement Script
==========================================
This script:
1. Backs up the current knowledge_base.json
2. Maps scraped field names to expected schema
3. Filters out low-quality case studies
4. Falls back to high-quality manual case studies if needed
5. Ensures minimum 10-15 quality case studies for demo
